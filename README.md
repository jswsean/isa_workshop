# isa_workshop
This repository hosts the materials and data used for the WB-ISA student workshop in July 2022

The repository contains two main folders:

* **replication**, which hosts the relevant files associated with the replication task.

* **walkthrough**, which contains the materials and datasets of a paper that we will be going through. The paper that we will be using 
for the replication is: Martinez-Bravo, M. (2017). The local political economy effects of school construction in Indonesia. *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*, 9(2), 256-89.

All replication data are taken from the [Inter-university Consortium of Political and Social Research website](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/), that is maintained by 
the University of Michigan. All errors remain my own.
