# What motivated the paper?

* There have been massive increases in school enrollment and educational attainment 
among developing countries in the last decades

<img src="indo_students.jpg" style="position:absolute; right:0; top:500px;">

--

* How would this affect local governance?

--

* Martinez-Bravo (MB, 2017) looks at **the impact of large school construction program** 
in Indonesia (the INPRES program) on **village governance and public good provisions**.

# How the author does it 

* **Key institutional feature**: 

    + INPRES program started in 1974
    <img src="indo_students.jpg" style="position:absolute; right:0; top:550px;">
--
    + Village head candidates must be at least 25 years old
--

* **Treatment**: Village-elections in which newly educated cohorts (the INPRES cohorts) 
could run as village head candidates

--

* **Outcome**: Village-level public good provisions

--

* MB used DiD strategy to compare village-level outcomes among:
  
--
  
    + Villages before and after the INPRES cohorts could run as candidates 
--
    + Villages that had run their first INPRES cohort elections and those that had not
    
---
# What's the result?

* First election to which the newly educated cohorts could run as candidates 
led to **increases in provision of key public goods**:

--

    + Number of doctors
--
    + Presence of primary health care centers
--
    + Access to basic services, i.e., safe drinking water and garbage disposal
--

* Effects are **stronger** for villages where the INPRES program was more intense. 

--

* Effects are heterogenous across villages as a function of villagers' 
**demand for public goods**.

--

* Validating the hypothesized causal pathways:

--
    
    + **First-stage**: INPRES school constructions induced increased in the education of village head 
    that is ultimately elected 
--
    + **Second-stage**: More educated village heads better reallocate their budgets 
--
    + **Second-stage**: More educated village heads manage their projects better.

# Data

<img src="indo_students.jpg" style="position:absolute; right:0; top:500px;">

* Data: Village Potentials (*Potensi Desa*), merged with INPRES school data
--

    
    + Between 1986 - 2003

    + Java island only: 9,855 villages (excluding *kelurahan*), 
    4 provinces, 82 districts

# Methods: key institutional feature

<img src="indo_students.jpg" style="position:absolute; right:0; top:500px;">

* First cohort 'treated' by INPRES schools: 7 YOs in 1974

--

    + First INPRES cohort will be eligible to run for office by 1992 (25 Y.O.)

--

* Villages run elections every 8 years 

--

* Election timing varies across villages

--

* Year of first election post-1992 captures the timing at which INPRES cohorts could start running for office.

# Methods: key institutional feature

* Does the timing of increase in public good provision correspond to the 
timing of first post-1992 election? 

  $$y_{vt} = \beta_0 + \sum^{2003}_{s=1990} (\delta_s \times Num\_{INPRES}_{v}) \gamma_{s} + \alpha_v + \delta_t +      \epsilon_{vt}$$

--

* $v, t$ denote villages and time periods, respectively

--

* $\gamma_s$ denotes the event-study effects of INPRES schools 
  
--

* Equation is estimated separately for different village groups (formed based on their election periods):

--

    + 1992-1993 election group
    + 1994-1996 
    + 1997-2000
